# Cryptocurrencies

Unsupervised Machine Learning

I was asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since there is no known output for what I am looking for, I decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I used a clustering algorithm and used data visualizations to share my findings.

Steps Involved:

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA 

- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
